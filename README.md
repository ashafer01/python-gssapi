=============

Note
----
There is a newer project which has superseded this one,
[https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi](https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi).
Please use that package if suitable for your needs, as this project is unlikely to be
developed further.

Attempt at an object-oriented interface to GSSAPI for Python.
This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license (see LICENSE.txt).

Documentation
-------------
Documentation for this package is available at
[https://pythonhosted.org/python-gssapi/](https://pythonhosted.org/python-gssapi/)

Python3 Support
---------------
Python-gssapi now uses [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/) to interface with the C GSSAPI library
and should install without any problems on Python 3. If you encounter bugs, please open an issue in
the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/sigmaris/python-gssapi/issues).
